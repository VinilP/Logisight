Execution Plan for Logistics Insight System
ðŸ”¹ Execution Plan
Phase 1 â€“ Problem Understanding & Documentation
Goal: Create a professional write-up explaining the business challenge, solution approach, and use cases.â€¨Deliverables: A Word document with explanation + one diagram.
Phase 2 â€“ Prototype Program
Goal: Build a lightweight demo program that can:
	â€¢	Aggregate sample data (from third-assignment-sample-data-set).
	â€¢	Correlate basic events.
	â€¢	Generate narrative insights.
Deliverables: A simple Python program (e.g., Jupyter notebook or script).
Phase 3 â€“ Demo & Recording
Goal: Run the program with sample queries (the listed use cases), record a screen + voice walkthrough.â€¨Deliverables: A recorded demo video.
Phase 4 â€“ Packaging & Delivery
Goal: Share everything in an organized way.â€¨Deliverables:
	â€¢	GitHub repo with code & instructions.
	â€¢	Folder link containing: Word document, demo video.
	â€¢	Draft email to send with the links.




ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step AI Prompts
Step 1 â€“ Write-Up (Word Document)
Prompt:â€¨*"Act as a business consultant. Write a professional document explaining the logistics delivery failure problem. Structure it into:
	â€¢	Business Challenge
	â€¢	Problem in Detail
	â€¢	Strategic Need
	â€¢	Proposed Solution Approach (data aggregation, correlation, insights, recommendations)
	â€¢	Example Use Cases (from list provided).
Make the language concise, executive-friendly, and solution-oriented. Insert a simple architecture diagram showing how different data sources feed into an analytics engine that generates insights & recommendations. Output in Word (.docx) format."*

Step 2 â€“ Sample Program
Prompt:â€¨*"Write a simple Python script that:
	â€¢	Reads mock data from CSV/Excel files (orders, fleet logs, warehouse, complaints, external conditions).
	â€¢	Aggregates data into a single structure.
	â€¢	Performs basic correlation (e.g., link delays to weather/traffic/stockouts).
	â€¢	Generates human-readable explanations for sample queries.
The script should be lightweight, runnable locally, and not require a full backend or UI. Use pandas for data manipulation. Provide example queries and show printed outputs for 2â€“3 use cases."*

Step 3 â€“ Demo Walkthrough
Prompt:â€¨*"Generate a step-by-step walkthrough script for me to record a demo video. The walkthrough should:
	â€¢	Briefly restate the problem.
	â€¢	Show the code files and explain the data aggregation logic.
	â€¢	Run the script with sample use cases (e.g., â€˜Why were deliveries delayed in city X yesterday?â€™).
	â€¢	Show the narrative outputs and explain them in plain English.
	â€¢	End with how this prototype can be scaled into a production solution."*

Step 4 â€“ Packaging
Prompt:â€¨*"Generate:
	â€¢	A README.md file for GitHub explaining project purpose, setup, and usage.
	â€¢	A suggested email draft to send the GitHub link, Word document, and demo recording. The email should be professional, concise, and client-facing."*
