# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Logistics Insight System is designed to address the critical business challenge of delivery failures and delays in logistics operations. Currently, operations managers must manually investigate across siloed systems to understand why deliveries failed, making the process reactive, time-consuming, and error-prone. This system will be delivered in phases: Phase 1 creates professional documentation with diagrams, Phase 2 builds a lightweight prototype program for data aggregation and correlation, Phase 3 demonstrates the system with recorded walkthroughs, and Phase 4 packages everything for delivery. The system will aggregate multi-domain data from orders, fleet logs, warehouse dispatch times, external conditions, and customer complaints to automatically correlate events and generate human-readable insights with actionable recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want to query specific delivery failure scenarios, so that I can quickly understand root causes without manual investigation across multiple systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask "Why were deliveries delayed in city X yesterday?" THEN the system SHALL analyze all relevant data sources and provide a comprehensive explanation
2. WHEN I query about a specific client's order failures THEN the system SHALL correlate order data with fleet logs, warehouse logs, external factors, and customer feedback
3. WHEN I request analysis for a specific time period THEN the system SHALL aggregate data across all domains for that timeframe
4. WHEN external factors like weather or traffic are involved THEN the system SHALL automatically include these contextual elements in the analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want the system to automatically correlate events across different data sources, so that I can identify systemic issues and patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN delivery failures occur THEN the system SHALL automatically link order data with fleet GPS traces, driver notes, warehouse dispatch times, and external conditions
2. WHEN analyzing warehouse performance THEN the system SHALL correlate stockouts with order cancellations and customer complaints
3. WHEN traffic spikes are detected THEN the system SHALL link them to late deliveries in affected routes
4. WHEN recurring patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL highlight systemic issues like bottlenecks at specific warehouses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want human-readable insights instead of raw dashboards, so that I can quickly understand complex delivery scenarios and their root causes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates insights THEN it SHALL provide narrative explanations instead of raw data dumps
2. WHEN multiple factors contribute to failures THEN the system SHALL explain the relationship between different causes
3. WHEN presenting analysis THEN the system SHALL use clear, business-friendly language that non-technical stakeholders can understand
4. WHEN complex correlations exist THEN the system SHALL break them down into digestible explanations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want actionable recommendations for operational improvements, so that I can proactively address delivery issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN delivery failures are analyzed THEN the system SHALL suggest specific operational changes like rescheduling, staffing adjustments, or address verification
2. WHEN capacity issues are identified THEN the system SHALL recommend resource allocation adjustments
3. WHEN external factors cause delays THEN the system SHALL suggest mitigation strategies for similar future scenarios
4. WHEN onboarding new high-volume clients THEN the system SHALL predict potential failure risks and recommend preventive measures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want to analyze specific sample use cases through natural language queries, so that I can validate the system's analytical capabilities with real business scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask "Why were deliveries delayed in city X yesterday?" THEN the system SHALL analyze traffic conditions, weather, warehouse performance, driver availability, and external factors for that specific city and timeframe
2. WHEN I query "Why did Client X's orders fail in the past week?" THEN the system SHALL examine that client's order patterns, delivery addresses, payment modes, failure reasons, and correlate with fleet logs and external factors
3. WHEN I ask "Explain the top reasons for delivery failures linked to Warehouse B in August?" THEN the system SHALL analyze warehouse logs, picking times, dispatch delays, stock issues, and correlate with downstream delivery performance for that specific warehouse and month
4. WHEN I query "Compare delivery failure causes between City A and City B last month?" THEN the system SHALL identify location-specific factors, traffic patterns, weather conditions, warehouse performance, and driver availability differences between the two cities
5. WHEN I ask "What are the likely causes of delivery failures during the festival period, and how should we prepare?" THEN the system SHALL analyze seasonal patterns, increased order volumes, external event impacts, and provide preparation recommendations
6. WHEN I query "If we onboard Client Y with ~20,000 extra monthly orders, what new failure risks should we expect and how do we mitigate them?" THEN the system SHALL predict failure scenarios based on order volume impact, delivery location analysis, warehouse capacity, driver availability, and provide mitigation strategies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an operations manager, I want to query historical data using flexible time expressions, so that I can analyze trends and patterns across extended time periods beyond just recent days or weeks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify relative time periods like "3 months ago" or "6 weeks ago" THEN the system SHALL calculate the appropriate date range and analyze data for that period
2. WHEN I query using specific months like "January 2024" or "March" THEN the system SHALL analyze data for the entire specified month and year
3. WHEN I specify quarters like "Q1 2024" or "last quarter" THEN the system SHALL analyze data for the appropriate 3-month period
4. WHEN I use year-based queries like "2023" or "last year" THEN the system SHALL analyze annual data patterns and trends
5. WHEN I specify date ranges like "January to March 2024" or "between June and August" THEN the system SHALL analyze data across the specified multi-month period
6. WHEN historical data is requested beyond available data range THEN the system SHALL inform the user of data availability limits and provide analysis for the available period
7. WHEN I combine time expressions with other filters like "Client X's performance in Q2 2023" THEN the system SHALL apply both the time filter and entity filter correctly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to interact with the system through a simple program interface, so that I can demonstrate and test the analytical capabilities without complex UI requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the program THEN it SHALL provide a command-line or simple interface for entering queries
2. WHEN I input sample use case questions THEN the system SHALL process them and return comprehensive insights
3. WHEN the system processes queries THEN it SHALL aggregate data from all relevant CSV sources (orders, clients, drivers, warehouses, fleet_logs, external_factors, feedback, warehouse_logs)
4. WHEN demonstrating the system THEN it SHALL work with the provided sample dataset without requiring external APIs or databases

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want comprehensive documentation and demo materials, so that I can understand the solution approach and see it in action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL include a professional Word document explaining the business challenge, solution approach, and use cases
2. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL include a simple architecture diagram showing data flow from sources to insights
3. WHEN the demo is recorded THEN it SHALL include screen + voice walkthrough showing the program running with sample queries
4. WHEN the project is packaged THEN it SHALL include a GitHub repo with code, instructions, and organized delivery materials
