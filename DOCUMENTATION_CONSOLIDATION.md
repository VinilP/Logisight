# Documentation Consolidation Summary

## Query Documentation Consolidation

### ❌ **Removed Redundant File**
- **`docs/Sample_Queries_and_Expected_Outputs.md`** 
  - Contained theoretical examples and expected output formats
  - Many queries didn't work with actual sample data
  - Had placeholder examples that weren't tested

### ✅ **Enhanced Consolidated File**
- **`docs/Sample_Queries_and_Results.md`** (renamed from `Working_Sample_Queries_and_Results.md`)
  - Contains actual working queries with real results
  - Includes data analysis summary showing what data is available
  - Shows successful query executions with performance metrics
  - Provides both theoretical framework AND practical examples

## 📊 **Consolidation Benefits**

### **Eliminated Confusion**
- **Before**: Two similar files with overlapping content
- **After**: Single comprehensive source of truth
- **Result**: Clear guidance for users on what queries actually work

### **Improved Accuracy**
- **Before**: Theoretical examples that might not work
- **After**: Tested examples with actual results
- **Result**: Users can trust the documentation

### **Better User Experience**
- **Before**: Users had to check multiple files to understand queries
- **After**: Everything in one place with clear sections
- **Result**: Faster onboarding and fewer support questions
